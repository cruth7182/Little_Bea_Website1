# Little_Bea_Website1

A responsive website to advertise Little Bea Enterprises.

Description
The Little Bea Enterprises website serves as a practice page for me to explore web design.
While learning web design, I also work as a reading tutor for students in grades 10-12.
This website will advertise my tutoring services while I also practice web development.
